The hosts file on Windows is a text file that maps IP addresses to domain names or host names. It's located in the following folder: 

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

To edit the hosts file, you'll need administrative privileges. You can do this by: 

1. Clicking Start and selecting Notepad
2. Clicking Run as administrator
3. Selecting File > Open
4. Navigating to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
5. Choosing All Files
6. Adding a custom IP address followed by a space and domain name to the hosts file

The hosts file is a common part of an operating system's IP implementation. It contains lines of text with an IP address in the first text field, followed by one or more host names.
