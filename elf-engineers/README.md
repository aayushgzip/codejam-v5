A timer that helps structure work sessions with intervals of focused work and scheduled breaks.


**STEPS TO RUN:**

 make folder "static", and within it create "css", "images", "js" folders. 
 keep the things as needed inside these folders, respectively.
 
 Pomodoro Folder - static - css - style.css
                           - js - script.js
                           - images - ring.png and berry.png
                 - templates - index.html
                 - timer.py
                 - env folder

2. Create a virtual environment (make sure the virtualenv library is installed within Python on your computer)
To do this, write "virtualenv env" to create.

3. write ".\env\Scripts\activate.ps1" to activate. then write pip install flask to install flask in this.

## Customizable Work and Break Durations
Users can adjust the lengths of their work sessions and break times to fit their preferences or productivity needs.


## Focus Mode/ Web Block

A mode designed to minimize distractions, likely by hiding or limiting notifications or irrelevant elements.


**PRECAUTIONS:**
ALWAYS SAVE THE ORIGINAL HOST FILE BEFOREHAND BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE FOR WEB BLOCKER (aka focusmode.py).

The hosts file on Windows is a text file that maps IP addresses to domain names or host names. It's located in the following folder: 

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

To edit the hosts file, you'll need administrative privileges. You can do this by: 

1. Clicking Start and selecting Notepad
2. Clicking Run as administrator
3. Selecting File > Open
4. Navigating to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
5. Choosing All Files
6. Adding a custom IP address followed by a space and domain name to the hosts file

The hosts file is a common part of an operating system's IP implementation. It contains lines of text with an IP address in the first text field, followed by one or more host names.
